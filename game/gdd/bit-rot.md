# Bit Rot

A deadly disease swept across the world - but humanity eventually discovered a cure.
The problem? The vaccine was rushed, released without proper testing.

As fear spread, misinformation followed. Entire nations turned against the cure, calling it a lie.
Riots broke out, labs were burned, and most of the remaining vaccines were destroyed.

Only a handful of people managed to get a dose. 
The rest were forced to make an impossible choice - save themselves, or save someone they loved.

Now, everyone is vulnerable.
And once youâ€™re infected... there's no coming back... until the next dose.
