Developer: Gustavo Kuklinski

## Plot
A deadly disease swept across the world - but humanity eventually discovered a cure.
The problem? The vaccine was rushed, released without proper testing.

As fear spread, misinformation followed. Entire nations turned against the cure, calling it a lie.
Riots broke out, labs were burned, and most of the remaining vaccines were destroyed.

Only a handful of people managed to get a dose. 
The rest were forced to make an impossible choice - save themselves, or save someone they loved.

Now, everyone is vulnerable.
Is the vaccine a cure, or a spread?

### Back story
You are in a safe haven, an ground petrol mine in the middle of the vulcanic islands circle.
The company is one of a few who still powering the world after the pandemic.
Some countries fall apart, the nations who left ware in the pacific, Australia,
part of South America and a few nation spread cells around Europe.

Next Petrol was an international Brazilian company still sending energy to the world.
And the other business, producing and shipping vaccines for the W.H.O made offshore.

All the stabilitie on land were upside down. Also with the main plant. Probably
trilions brazilian reais would be an future memory of an expance. If nations fall,
who will pay our bills? Will we riot and build a energy tample. Probably the thoughts 
when Petrus was created by the las century 60s. Now we live and work on this to try to
have a purpose in life.

People here just come and go, some never come back to land and others... Become a memory.

You've signed to work in exchange to be safe. Safety is the expance of a few, the biggest clients 
in biggest countries, the very populated ones like the coast of Brazil, Half of USA in a thing 
line east to west and Australia.
The Capital of this new world: Rio de Janeiro. Where who send the cards live. 
A crowd of economists, doctors, physicians and a lof the science, religion and politics...

Over here, you who mainly two jobs: Do what you always did to earn money and keep the 
oil running the world.

On the main house I was doing my dialy job paperwork at the platform when some people 
come from the heliport wing reporting a breach again - Another day in heaven - We have a counter
showing the years the last breach happened, but this got different. Probably the big ones were
trying to turn the facility one of the flu reserach. The chopper was full, like some state was just
falling apart again. 

I've heard some strange noises of motors going away, and when I realize, there was no boat to mainland.
But for my lucky, Next Petrol Manufacture Plant was close to main by the tunnel. The short tides of the 
island and the local anccient relogion, probably adored some kind of god in this part of the land, just 
where the factory is landed.

Probably you have choices:
- Try to survive.
- Go to the heliport and try to call help?
- Go to mainland to check if everything is ok?
- Secure all this factory and go back to Rio as a hero!
- Exit the game.

Wllcome to BITROT.

### Try to survive.
You already know, nobody is comming, its your own.
How to romantize the moment of fully loneness by a strange selfish peace.
Time to move own into reality, loot everything and be roque, trust is rare.

### Go to the heliport and try to call help?
The chooper just left with some of the ritches. 
The boats were left with the, let me quote: "Required and assistant personal". I'm the first at NP.
Maybe I can use the radio to call some boat or chooper.

### Go to mainland to check if everything is ok?
Probably I'm going by foot. The distribution center is just south, there's no error in the tunnel.
Just more them 1000 working on the depths of earth. From civilians to the rich managers.
What kind of things could I find there?

### Secure all this factory and go back to Rio as a hero!
The first rule of the NP work manual. There's also seminaries on how to manage the platform. People
grow with this at schools: "What would you do if you owned the company" - Some people come and go
frequently promoting this heroim, the retirement plan is everything and free housing at the beach!
