## Plot
A pandemic swept the globe. We found a cure — and released it too soon. 
Fear turned to fury: labs burned, vaccines destroyed. Only a few doses remain. 
Now the world runs on a thin, fragile supply of power and trust.

You work at Next Petrol, an offshore Brazilian firm running an underground 
petrol mine in a volcanic island chain. It’s supposed to be safe. Today, 
it isn’t. The chopper left. The boats are gone. The tunnels might be intact. 
Your choices are simple and brutal: survive, call for help, go to shore, 
or secure the factory and hope Rio notices.

Welcome to BITROT.

### Back story
You are in a safe haven: an underground petrol mine in the middle of a 
volcanic island chain. The company that runs it is one of the few still 
powering the world after the pandemic. Some countries collapsed; the 
survivors clustered in parts of the Pacific, Australia, sections of 
South America, and scattered enclaves across Europe.

Next Petrol is an international Brazilian company still exporting energy 
to the world. Another business — producing and shipping vaccines for 
the WHO — operates offshore.

All the stability on land was overturned, including at the main plant. 
Trillions of Brazilian reais feel like a future memory, an expense no 
one can recover. If nations fall, who will pay our bills? Will we riot 
and build an energy temple? Those were the thoughts when Petrus was 
created in the 1960s. Now we live and work here to find purpose.

People come and go; some never return to land and others… become memories.

You signed on to work in exchange for safety. Safety is the privilege 
of a few — the biggest clients in the most populated regions: the Brazilian 
coast, much of the U.S. along an east–west corridor, and Australia. 
The capital of this new world order is Rio de Janeiro — home of those 
who still pull the strings: economists, doctors, scientists, religious 
leaders, and politicians.

Here, you have mainly two jobs: do what you always did to earn money, 
and keep the oil running.

I was doing my daily paperwork in the main house when people came from 
the heliport wing reporting a breach — another day in paradise. We keep 
a counter showing the years since the last breach, but this one felt different. 
Maybe the large groups were trying to turn the facility into a flu 
research site. The chopper had left full, as if a state was collapsing again.

I heard strange engine noises fade away; when I looked, there was no boat 
to the mainland. For my luck, the Next Petrol Manufacturing Plant was close 
to the main site via the tunnel. The short tides of the island and the local 
ancient religion — a people who probably once worshipped a god tied to this 
land — are centered where the factory sits.

You probably have choices:

- Try to survive.
- Go to the heliport and try to call for help.
- Go to the mainland to check if everything is okay.
- Secure the factory and return to Rio as a hero.

Welcome to BITROT.

### Try to survive
You already know: nobody is coming. It’s on you. How do you romanticize the moment 
of full loneliness into a strange, selfish peace? Time to face reality, loot what 
you can, and go rogue — trust is rare.

### Go to the heliport and try to call help

The chopper just left with some of the rich. The boats were prioritized for, quote, 
"required and assistant personnel."
I’m the first one at Next Petrol. Maybe I can use the radio to call a boat or another chopper.

### Go to the mainland to check if everything is okay

You’d probably go on foot. The distribution center is just south; the tunnel 
should be intact. There are more than a thousand people working deep underground — 
from civilians to senior managers. What might you find there?

### Secure the factory and go back to Rio as a hero

That’s the first rule of the NP manual. There are seminars on how to run 
the platform: “What would you do if you owned the company?” People come and go, 
always selling the idea of heroism. The retirement plan promises everything — 
even free housing at the beach.

    Hello! I'm Marechal Souza! On head of NS_X0A6!
    We were luck to be here when the choper leave.

    Hope you are smart.
    Get my gear, I wont need them now.

    If you try to get the choper, keep in mind: 100.000 for the landing back.
    Be brave to try out.
    Well, for our luck we have an infinite stock of Vaccine.
    If someday it ends, or anyone need Vacs, I'll be here to serve
    those souls.

    You can try the tunnel. It goes to the Heli facility and the town.
    You can choose your path kiddo.

    This is a job for adults.
    I don't think Rio will come.

    Good luck!
